# PPublisher

## PPublisher is the light weight publish/subscribe library.

This library can be used for the purpose of operating loosely coupled between software layers like RxSwift and Combine Framework.
It's very lightweight and consumes little memory, as only the minimum amount of observing functionality is implemented.
It is suitable for use in apps with limited memory, such as App Clips introduced from iOS14.
